The Typescript Core Guidelines are a set of tried-and-true guidelines, rules, and best practices about coding in Typescript

The [TypeScipt Coding Guidelines](TypeScriptCodingGuidelines.md) are a collaborative effort led by Richard Zampieri with the intent to establish good practices when developing using TypeScript. They are the result of many
person-years of discussion and iterations across many different industries and different projects. The rules established in this document has the only purpose to serve as a general guide for you or your development team. You can copy and modified to better suit your own need.

## Getting started

The guidelines themselves are found at [TypeScript Coding Guidelines](TypeScriptCodingGuidelines.md). The Guidelines are a constantly evolving document without a strict "release" cadence.

## Background and scope

The aim of the guidelines is to help people to use TypeScript effectively. A code easily readable, maintainable, and scalable. Also to establish a common ground for the community to follow when developing using TypeScript.

We hope that this document can also help you to get started with TypeScript, or if you come with a javascript background, to help you in the transition to TypeScript.

The guidelines are focused on all the resources provided by the TypeScript language as well as design patterns that can be use effectively in TypeScript.

You may find some of the rules contrary to your expectations or even contrary to your experience. If we haven't suggested that you change your
coding style in any way, we have failed! Please try to verify or disprove rules! In particular, we'd really like to have some of our rules
backed up with measurements or better examples.

You will find some of the rules obvious or even trivial. Please remember that one purpose of a guideline is to help someone who is less
experienced or coming from a different background or language to get up to speed.

## Contributions and LICENSE

Comments and suggestions for improvements are most welcome. We plan to modify and extend this document as our understanding improves and the
language and the set of available libraries improve. More details are found at [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [LICENSE](./LICENSE).
